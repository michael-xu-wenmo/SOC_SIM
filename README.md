This is a simple simulation of the societies.
There are different species of entity that the simulation can create.
Each species must inherit from the entity class, but every species' self.do is different. 

The goal can be different for each simulation: To be the last standing, to gain the most points, to have the greatest population or etc.

(I am just a beginner to programing, and simulations. If there are any suggestions to make the code better, please tell me. 如有需要改进的地方，还请多多指教。)
